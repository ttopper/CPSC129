# Approaches

Not surprisingly there’s more than one approach\...

1.  Here’s one:

    > The algorithm starts by dividing the area into an array of
    > rectangular cells, each with 4 walls. Each cell is given a region
    > identifier. Then, at random, we find two cells in different
    > regions, remove the intervening wall and combine the two regions
    > into 1. We repeat this (width x height - 1) times. Now there is
    > only one region which contains all the cells. This guarantees that
    > there is a route from any cell to any other cell. Also, because
    > we’ve removed the smallest number of walls to achieve this state
    > there will only be one direct route (ie. one that doesn’t involve
    > retracing your
    > steps).[[^*]](http://www.eddaardvark.co.uk/oldjava/maze.html#explain)

2.  And here’s a lightly edited version of a maze carving approach from
    [Robert Scott Ladd](http://www.coyotegulch.com/) (the link is to his
    home page, the original maze page is
    [404](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.4.5)).

    > Generate a new maze with all walls standing. The maze carving
    > algorithm begins by selecting an entrance” cell, opening the
    > outside wall, and then following this algorithm: Pick a random
    > direction, and move to the adjoining cell in that direction, if
    > you haven’t visited it before. Add the previous cell location to
    > the list of visited cells. Knock out the wall between the cell you
    > came from and the one you’re in, then move to another
    > randomly-selected adjacent cell. Repeat the process until you
    > reach a place that is surrounded by cells that have all already
    > been visited. At this point, work your way back through the list
    > of visited cells until you find one that does have an unvisited
    > neighbor, and start carving again. The result is a maze with a
    > long twisty solution and lots of long dead ends.

3.  And yet another from SlickCow:

    > To draw a maze, first create some kind of outer shell with two
    > holes\--one that will function as a start and another as a finish.
    > This shell determines the overall shape of your maze, so make it
    > something interesting to look at.
    >
    > To add complexity, you have to draw internal lines, following one
    > simple rule: any and every line you draw must be connected to some
    > other line at one of its ends. That is, you should draw lines that
    > branch out from a line that was already drawn.
    >
    > This forces your first line to be connected to some part of your
    > outer shell, but your second line could be connected to either the
    > shell or the first line. Your third line could be connected to
    > either the shell, first, or second line\...
    >
    > Go ahead and go crazy drawing lines. The more lines there are, the
    > harder the maze becomes. A very fine tipped pencil or pen will
    > allow for extremely complex mazes. It helps to leave the open end
    > of lines at places people are likely to come to traversing the
    > maze. This forces them to make a decision between at least two
    > corridors\... one is correct, the others must be wrong.
    >
    > Using this one rule, there will always be one and only one pathway
    > from the start to the finish. Any line you draw without
    > connections to other lines will not affect the navigation through
    > the maze, but it could add certain aesthetic qualities. Any line
    > you draw that has two connections presents an opportunity to block
    > off the correct pathway from start to finish. It is something to
    > be avoided.[[^*]](http://everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=606941)
