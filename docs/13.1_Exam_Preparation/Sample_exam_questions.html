<body><h1>Sample Exam Questions</h1> 
 
<ol> 
<li>(<i>5 marks)</i> What does the acronym ___ stand for? What is the rationale
for this design pattern?</li> 
<li>(<i>2 marks</i>) True or False:<br /> 
T F The first parameter in a class method's argument list must be called
self.</li> 
<li>(<i>5 marks each</i>) Which of the six main sorting methods we studied (straight insertion, straight selection, straight exchange/bubble, Shell sort, quicksort and heap sort) would you implement for each of the following applications? Why?</li> 
<li>(<i>5 marks</i>) Here is an implementation of the ___ sort algorithm:<br /> 
...<br /> 
<ol type="a"> 
<li>Will it sort the list in ascending or descending
order?</li> 
<li>If it takes 3 milliseconds to sort a list of 2,000 elements, how
long would you expect it to take to sort a list of 8,000 elements?</li> 
</ol> 
</li> 
<li>(<i>20 marks</i>) Someone has written a function called
<code>eo</code> to place all
the even values in a list before all the odd values. What would be a good
set of test data to verify that this function works correctly? Provide a
very brief (1 line) rationale for each test you propose.</li> 
<li><p>(<i>45 marks</i>) Not the Smallest, Not the Largest, the
Middle</p> 
<p>(<i>We did this in class this year, but it was on last year's final
exam. I include it here to give you an idea of the difficulty of the
longer problems on the exam</i>).</li></p> 
<p>The median value in a list is the value that would be in the middle
if the list was sorted, i.e. the same number of values are smaller than
the median as are larger than it*.</p> 
<ol type="a"> 
<li><p>Start with the simplest thing that could possibly work. Write a
function that returns the median of a list of positive numbers using the
following approach.</p> 
<pre><code>consider each value in the list (until the median is found)
    count how many values in the list are smaller than it
    and how many values are larger
    based on the counts above decide if it is the median
</code></pre> 
<p>If the test is carefully written this can work. Show the test cases
you use in verifying your code.</p> 
</li> 
<li>What order is this algorithm?</li> 
<li>While correct, the approach in a) above is inefficient. For example, if we&#xfffd;re working with the list
[31, 18, 72, 91, 84, 53, 25]
we will discover in the first step that 31 is not the median because
there are 3 numbers less than or equal to it, but 5 numbers greater than
or equal to it. From this we know not only that 31 is not the median,
but that the median must be some number larger than 31. This means that
when we get to the value 18 we can skip it, i.e. not bother counting how
many values are larger or smaller than it, because we know it cannot be
the median. Similarly once we discover that 72 is not the median we can
skip 91 and 84. Modify your code from a) based on this insight.</li> 
</ol> 
<p>*Fine print: Actually it is the number of values smaller than or
equal to it, and larger than or equal to it. Furthermore, if there is an
even number of values in the list the median may not be easily defined,
e.g. what is the median value in the list [1, 2, 3, 4]? In this case
your code may return -1.</p>
