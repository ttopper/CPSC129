# Your Turn

You may recall that the our Controller never defined the Update
operation. Thatâ€™s because I resisted hogging all the fun, and left it
to you as an exercise for the assignment. In addition the assignment
will have you implement another class that can be stored in our
ObjectServer, e.g. a Riddle class or FamousProgrammer or other simple
class of your choice.

Use these modules as your starting points.

Read the version histories to see how they are changed from the previous
versions you worked with. For the most part the changes are small, but
they generally include:

-   renaming modules to not include version numbers
-   including more tests so that every method is called.

As you change them be sure to save archival copies and to record your
changes in version comments.
