# Assignment Marking Scheme

Programming problems will be marked out of 10 according to the following
scheme.

**9**, **10** → Excellent work. Does (or exceeds!) what the assignment
requested exceptionally well. The final product is simple, yet elegant.

**7**, **8** → Good work. Does what the assignment requested, and does
it well: thought has been given to the design, attention has been paid
to details, and care taken in the implementation.

**5**, **6** → Acceptable work. Does what the assignment requested, but
no more, and without elegance or craft, i.e. your program works
correctly, can be read, is not horribly inefficient.

**0**-**4** → Unacceptable work. Does not do the minimum specified by
the assignment.

Sometimes it is helpful to remind ourselves what key words mean:

*ex·cel·lent*
:   ---adj. 1. Of the highest or finest quality; exceptionally good of
    its kind.

*good*
:   ---adj. 1. Having positive or desirable qualities; not bad or poor.

*ac·cept·a·ble*
:   ---adj. 1. Worthy of being accepted. 2. Adequate enough to satisfy a
    need, requirement, or standard; satisfactory. 3. Designating an
    amount or level that can be endured or allowed.
