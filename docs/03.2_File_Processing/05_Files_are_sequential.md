# Important note: Files are sequential

One thing that is not illustrated by the examples so far is that files
are sequential. They derived from physical tape devices that only went
forward or all the way back to the beginning of the file, so you are
always moving forward through a file as you read from it. Thus after
doing a `.read()` from a file you are at the end of it and doing another
`.read()` will not reread it, e.g.

    >>> f = open('text_file.txt','r')
    >>> s = f.read()
    >>> s
    'The first line.\nLine 2.\nThe third and last line.\n'
    >>> p = f.read()
    >>> p
    ''
    >>> f.close()
    >>> 

Note that it is not an error to try and read from the end of a file
(there’s no error message above), you just don’t get anything because
there is nothing more to get (see how `p` is a null string above?).
