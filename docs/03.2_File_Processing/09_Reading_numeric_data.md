# Reading numeric data

In the examples so far we have read string data, but what if we wanted
to read numerical data, e.g. to read our coordinates back in and
reconstitute the list `coords`?

Pseudocode,

    Open the file
    Initialize coords to an empty list
    Read it a line at a time
        Split the line into parts at blanks
        Convert each part into an integer value
        Append the integer values to the list coords

Or in Python,

``` python
# read_coords.py
coords = []
fname = raw_input('Name of file to read from? ')
f = open(fname, 'r')
for line in f:
    (x_string, y_string) = line.split()
    coords.append([int(x_string),int(y_string)])
f.close()
print 'coords =', coords
```

A sample run:

    >>> 
    Name of file to read from? test.dat
    coords = [[12, 31], [75, 19], [28, 51]]
    >>>
