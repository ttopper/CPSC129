# Sorting Out Sorting

This week the heavy lifting in terms of presenting material is going to
be done by a historical set of videos. The video was originally a single 
production called **Sorting out Sorting**. It was created by Ronald 
Baecker at the University of Toronto in 1981. This was early days for 
both computer animation and *algorithm visualization*. The video’s 
animation (and sound) techniques were quickly superceded by Hollywood, 
but the visualizations are still very helpful in understanding how the 
algorithms work and indeed set the stage for much of what has followed 
in the evolution of algorithm visualization (AV).”[^*]

The video describes the operation and performance of nine classic
sorting algortihms, 3 each in 3 families.

|                      |     Families           |                    |
|----------------------|------------------------|--------------------|
| **Insertion Sorts**  | **Selection Sorts**    | **Exchange Sorts** |
| _Linear insertion_   | _Straight selection_   | _Bubble sort_      |
| Binary Insertion     | Tree sort              | Shaker sort        |
| _Shell sort_         | _Heap sort_            | _Quicksort_        |

I have italicized the names of the ones we will implement and compare.
This week we will do the first four. In two weeks we will return to the
topic of sorting and implement the Quicksort and Heap Sort algorithms.

You can view the video in segments on You Tube: [part
