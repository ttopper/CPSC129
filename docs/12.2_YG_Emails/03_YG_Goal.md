# Your Goal

Your job is to write a Python program that will take two text files
(e.g. [peoplesoft.txt](peoplesoft.txt) and
[activedirectory.txt](activedirectory.txt)) containing data exported
from each system and attempt to resolve the entries in them. You should
output a list of matches sorted in descending order by match quality,
where the possible quality values should include likely match”,
possible match”, and unmatched”,

  --------------- ------------------------- ----------------
  Name            Email                     Match quality
  Tim Topper      tim.topper@gov.yk.ca      Likely Match
  Michael Smith   michael.smith@gov.yk.ca   Likely Match
  Robert Timms    bob.timms@gov.yk.ca       Possible Match
  Michael Smith   mike.smith@gov.yk.ca      Possible Match
  Marlene Trent                             Unmatched
                  helpdesk@gov.yk.ca        Unmatched
  --------------- ------------------------- ----------------

Due to the complications we cannot automate the entire process, but with
around 5,000 employees if our program can match 80% of them with
confidence we have saved someone a lot of manual work.
