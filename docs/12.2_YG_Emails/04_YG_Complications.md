# Complications

The records for Tim Topper may be manageable, but looking through the
tables reveals other cases that are more difficult.

## Familiar name != Formal name

Robert Timms has login btimms and email address bob.timms@gov.yk.ca but
unless we knew that Roberts sometimes go by the name Bob (or Bobby) this
would be difficult to predict.

## Familiar name similar to Formal name

Richard Johnson has login rjohnson (which we would predict) but email
address rick.johnson@gov.yk.ca because he told the departmental network
admin who created the email address that his name was Rick Johnson. Now
in fairness that’s what everyone calls him, and so to keep his email
address guessable by people wanting to contact him it _should_ be
rick.johnson@gov.yk.ca. The real problem here is having two disconnected
databases.

## Names not unique

And then there are the Michael Smiths. The first one hired has login
msmith and email address Michael.Smith as we would predict. The second
one has login masmith (Since he is Michael Andrew Smith) and email
address Mike.Smith@gov.yk.ca since he goes by Mike rather than Michael.
What’s a busy network admin to do when the first login and email
address they enter is already taken?

## Not all employees have email addresses

Marlene Trent doesn’t have a login or an email address.

## Some email addresses don’t belong to employees

mail1@gov.yk.ca and helpdesk@gov.yk.ca don’t have names or employee ids
associated with them.
