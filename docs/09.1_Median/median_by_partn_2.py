# median_by_partn.py
#
# Based on the insight that the median value will be in the middle of a list
# of sorted values, plus the hint that we may be able to find it without
# completely sorting the list, we find the median by successive partitions
# of the list.
#
# Our strategy will be to partition as in quicksort initially,
# but then to further partition only the portion that will contain the median.
#
# Version history:
# 0 - Just partitioning the list into smaller and larger.
# 1 - Add stopping condition; discover infinite loop.
# 2 - Add equal list and refine code.

    # i.e. ones that are for internal use only.
