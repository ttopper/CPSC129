# Version history:
# 0 First inefficient attempt. Fails on some lists.
# 1 Refine test to account for possibility of duplicate values in list.
# 2 Let's use what we are learning about the list to reduce the number
#   of comparisons we do.
# 3 Instrumented version to get a sense of efficiency gained.
