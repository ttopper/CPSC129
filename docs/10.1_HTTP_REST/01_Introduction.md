# Introduction

In this module I will walk you through the development of a web server.
Not just a CGI script, but a complete server. It’s a long story, but I
hope it will be interesting for you to see what there is to a modern
REST architecture web server, and how objects can be made usable across
a network. Specifically, to see that there is not that much to it!

The final code produced isn’t vast, though it is certainly longer than
the recent algorithms we have been working on, but unlike them its logic
is straightforward if the requirements it is meeting are understood
before reading it. However providing enough background information for
you to create that understanding makes it a _long_ story.
