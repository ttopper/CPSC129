        #   1) POST /create/objtype
        #      => Create an obj of class objtype, and

        #
        # The other two are when we tunnel PUT and DELETE through POST.

        #         return a page displaying the modified object.
        #
        #   3) POST /uid with method field == 'DELETE'

        #
        # We could detect the true POST by looking at the URL POSTed to,
        # but this would not extend to tunneled PUTs and DELETEs because they
        # both use the same URL.
        #

        # field in all three cases and react appropriately.
        # Parse the query string to get method field which means first
        # parsing the form arguments into a dictionary.
        # 1) Is it a genuine POST?

            # i.e. one with form /create/obj_type,

                # The type of object to create is given by the suffix after /create/

            # Otherwise POSTing to a disallowed URL.
