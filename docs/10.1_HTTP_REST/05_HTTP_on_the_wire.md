# HTTP on the wire”

The HTTP protocol is a very simple one, a key to its widespread
implementation and thus its eventual success. A request consists of a
sequence of lines of text.The first one specifies the HTTP method
(verb), the resource (by its URL, or, rarely, its URI) being requested
and the HTTP protocol version, e.g.

    GET /index.html HTTP/1.0

There are four key HTTP
methods<sup>[^*](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html)</sup>,
([all of them](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Http#Request_methods))

GET
:   The GET method means retrieve whatever information ... is
    identified by the Request-URI. If the Request-URI refers to a
    data-producing process, it is the produced data which shall be
    returned as the entity in the response...”

PUT
:   The PUT method requests that the enclosed entity be stored under
    the supplied Request-URI.”

POST
:   The POST method is used to ... [provide] a block of data, such
    as the result of submitting a form, to a data-handling process;
    extend a database though an append operation.”

DELETE
:   The DELETE method requests that the origin server delete the
    resource identified by the Request-URI.”

The remaining lines, if any, are optional header lines that modify the
processing of the request. The end of the header lines is signalled by a
blank line. The format of each header line is a key or name followed by
a colon, followed by a string value. Here is a sample set of headers
([all headers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_headers)) for a
request for a page to give you an idea of the type of information that
is sent. I have bolded the header names to make them stand out, but in
the actual request it’s all plain text.

The server puts together a similar package when it returns its response:
a status line ([status
codes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes)), then a
set of header lines, followed by a blank line, followed by the content
of the response. Here are the headers returned by the request above:
