# Demo: Testing object_server.py

We can test object_server.py using an HTTP client. Two common
possibilities are the comand line client [curl](http://curl.haxx.se/)
and the Python-based client [RESTClient](http://restclient.org/).

Demonstrate using curl.

-   curl localhost # Issue GET for homepage
-   curl -X method url, e.g. curl -X GET localhost is equivalent to
    above.

Demonstrate RESTClient.
