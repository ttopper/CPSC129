# Big O Notation

Regardless of the method of analysis, the most common way to summarize
the performance of an algorithm is through Big O notation. Big O
notation describes the **growth rate** of the time or space an
algorithm requires as the problem increases in size. What do we mean by
the **size** of the problem? Intuitively we mean the number of things
it involves. In a payroll system the size might be the number of
employees, in a general database system, the number of records in the
system, for Google the number of web pages in the world. More
concretely, for our current problem, searching a list, it is best
measured by the number of items in the list, _n_.
