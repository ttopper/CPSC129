# Fancier input

HTML forms allow for quite a bit more types of input than we have taken
advantage of so far. Exploring the rest of them is easily done by
self-study. The next two pages provide a sample form showing the most
common form controls and a script that shows how to access its contents.
Neither is rocket science. Enjoy!
