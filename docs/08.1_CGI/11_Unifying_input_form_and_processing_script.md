# Unifying the input form and the processing script

At the moment we have to manage, and keep track of, and keep in sync,
two different files: the HTML input form and the processing script.
However taking advantage of the ability of programs to do selection we
can combine these two into a single file that can select the appropriate
response based on what is passed to the script. If the `FieldStorage`
instance has content then it was the result of a user filling out the
form and pressing `Submit`, and we should process the data. On the other
hand if the `FieldStorage` instance is empty it means no form has been
filled out (perhaps because they are coming directly to this URL from a
link or a search result) and we should present the form to the user. In
code this looks like this:

``` python
# mi2km_v3.py
#
# Demonstrates unified cgi script that detects whether request
# is:
# 1) from a completed form, or
# 2) a first time visit.
import cgi

# We read the templates in from external files because
# that makes them easier to create. You, or your web designer,
# can create complete HTML pages in your editor of choice
# and then you just replace the values to be interpolated for
# with appropriate format codes.
output_template = open("mi2km_output_v3.html","r").read()
input_template = open("mi2km_input_v3.html","r").read()

# Parse the CGI request into dictionary-like FieldStorage.
form = cgi.FieldStorage()

if 'miles' in form:
    # If they filled in the miles field, convert miles to km,
    miles = float( form['miles'].value )
    km = miles * 1.609
    # and display the output.
    print('Content-type: text/html\n')
    print(output_template % (miles, km))

elif 'km' in form:
    # If they filled in the km field, convert km to miles,
    km = float( form['km'].value )
    miles = km / 1.609
    # and display the output.
    print('Content-type: text/html\n')
    print(output_template % (miles, km))

else:
    # They filled in neither field so give them an input form to fill out.
    print('Content-type: text/html\n')
    print(input_template)
```

## Notes:

-   If you look carefully at
    [mi2km_output_v3.html](mi2km_output_v3.md) you will see that one
    common hack is required. % signs in CSS need to escaped, i.e.
    replaced with %% so the Python string interpolation mechanism wonâ€™t
    interpret them as formatting fields. This is usually avoided by
    importing the CSS file instead of inserting the styles into the HTML
    file (which is best practice, but I wanted to avoid a veritable
    explosion in the number of files we had to keep track of).
