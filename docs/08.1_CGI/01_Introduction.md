# Introduction

Int this section we’ll see how to provide access to our programs over
the web. There will be no tricky programming involved, no subtle
algorithms or complicated data structures. Instead the challenge is in
lining up all the pieces so they play nice together. We get to wear our
sysadmin hats instead of our programmer hats. It does of course have its
own frustrations, but they are new frustrations, and they do say “a
change is as good as a rest” so enjoy the change.
