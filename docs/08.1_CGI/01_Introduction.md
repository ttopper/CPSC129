# Introduction

This week we’ll see how to provide access to our programs over the web.
There will be no tricky programming involved, no subtle algorithms or
complicated data structures. Instead the challenge is in lining up all
the pieces so they play nice together. We get for a week to wear our
sysadmin hats instead of our programmer hats. It does of course have its
own frustrations, but they are new frustrations, and they do say a
change is as good as a rest” so enjoy the change.
