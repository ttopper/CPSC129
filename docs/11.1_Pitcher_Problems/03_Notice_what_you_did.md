# Second: Notice what you did

Hopefully you have noticed some characteristics of these problems:

-   The number of steps it takes to get to a solution varies.

-   There are only a few actions that can be taken: _filling_ a pitcher,
    _pouring_ from one pitcher to another, and _emptying_ a pitcher into
    the river.

A few less obvious characteristics:

-   There may be more than one way to solve the problem, e.g. problem
    two could also be solved like this: 1) Fill the ten-litre
    pitcher, 2) pour from it into the five-litre pitcher, 3) pour from
    it into the two-litre pitcher, 4) empty the two-litre pitcher into
    the river, 5) pour from the ten-litre pitcher again into the
    two-litre pitcher. Now there is one litre of water left in the
    ten-litre pitcher. This solution is longer than the one we saw
    before, and we naturally prefer shorter solutions, so let’s agree
    that we would like the shortest solution possible.

-   There may be no solution, e.g. Given a five-litre pitcher and a
    ten-litre pitcher measure one litre of water.”

-   A solution may involve more than one pitcher, e.g. the problem 
    You have a three-litre pitcher and a seven-litre pitcher. You need
    ten litres of water.” The solution is to fill them both, and now
    have you have the required ten liters of water in both pitchers
    combined.
