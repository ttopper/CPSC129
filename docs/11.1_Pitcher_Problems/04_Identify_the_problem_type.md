# Third: Identify the problem type

What kind of problem is this? Put another way, what problem we have seen before
is this one like? Well it’s not a calculation or formula problem. We
find the answer not by using some equations, but by trying out different
operations. In this way it is like brute-force problems we have seen
where our approach has been to try all possible combinations of filling
and pouring, and checking after each one to see if we have solved the
problem yet. So it’s a bit like the cryptarithm problem, and a bit like
maze carving, but not exactly like either of them.
