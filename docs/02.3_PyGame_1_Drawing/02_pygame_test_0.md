# Getting started with Pygame

1.  Go get and install pygame from
    <http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml>

    If youâ€™re on Windows choose the MSI file that matches the version
    of Python you run, e.g.

    `pygame-1.9.1.win32-py2.7.msi` if you are running Python 2.7.x

2.  Executing it should install pygame.

3.  You can check that pygame has been properly installed by running
    pygame_test_0.py:

    ![Image of pygame_test_0.py source
