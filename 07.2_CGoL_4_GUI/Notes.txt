Plans for Life's Visual Interface

What we need to do:
    Make room for the menu; check that display still works.
    Display icons.
    Detect mouse clicks in icons.
        Detect mouse clicks.
        Get mouse location.
        Mapping location to icon or cell.

Wiring icon clicks to actions, ideally functions.

Thinking about these commands, there isn't a perfect match between commands and program structure. This is common. The trick here is that lots of commands will involve pausing.

Modifications to the main loop:
if state != pause:
    age
    if state == PLAY_ONE: state = PAUSE
check for events and handle them
    open: set state to PAUSE then conduct dialogue
    save: set state to PAUSE then conduct dialogue
    pause: set state to PAUSE
    play: set state to PLAY_ONE
    fast forward: set state to PLAY
    edit: set state to PAUSE
    clear: set state to PAUSE then clear universe
